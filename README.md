# Note about the classifiers
We used the median value of the chance of admission feature as our threshold to binarize the result vector "Chance of Admit.
This was 73%. This value was both high enough to not necessarily suggest that someone with a low score would get it, and 
it was also the median value. A 73% chance is still a pretty darn good chance of being admitted, and it gave us the largest 
classification split. This, we believe, makes 0.73 an incredibly valid threshold with which to binarize the data.
